Ch 1 - Introduction to AWS

Cloud computing:
- on demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the internet with pay as you go pricing
- provides an easy way to access servers, sotrage, databases, and a broad set of application services that provide abstraction over the internet- hybrid:

6 Advantages:
- variable operational expense vs capital expense
    - pay for what you use
- economies of scale
    - lower variable cost than you would get on your own
- stop guessing capacity
    - have the exact capacity for business needs
    - scale up/down depending on need in a few minutes
- increase speed and agility
    - a click/few minutes away from new IT resources
    - reduce cost to experiment and develop
- focus on business differentiators
    - focus on business priorities instead of "boilerplate" IT work of maintaining IT resources
- go global in minutes
    - deploy globally to provide redundancy
    - deliver lower latency and better experiences for customers

Deployment Modes:
- all-in or hybrid
- all-in:
    - fully deployed in the cloud, all commponents of application running in the cloud 
        - can be cloud native or migrated from existing infrastructure
    - can be built on low level infrastructure or higher level services that provide abstraction
- hybrid:
    - connect infrastructure and applications between cloud based resources and existing resources
    - most common to extend and grow an organization's infrastructure while cloud resources connect to internal systems

AWS Fundamentals:
- capacity exactly matches your need
- pay for what you use
- economies of scale -> lower costs
- service is provided by a vendor experienced in running large scale networks
- security and compliance

Global Infrastructure
- multiple locations worldwide of regions and availability zones
    - region is a separate geographic area
    - each region has multiple isolated locations known as availability zones
    - data and resources are placed in multiple locations, but not replicated across regions unless specified
- regions are independent and isolated from other regions for fault tolerance and stability
- each AZ is isolated but AZ in a region are connected through low latency links
    - placed outside of geographic problematic areas like flood planes, etc
    - UPS for locations and back up generators to avoid single point of failure
    - AZ are redundantly connected to multiple tier 1 transit providers 
- HA by deploying across multiple AZ, create multisite solution (independent copy of each stack in 2+ AZ)

Security and compliance
- leverage AWS's offerings to meet security and compliance, lower operational overhead than on premise environment
- shared security responsibilities with the organization
- organization can secure anything it deploys on AWS, while AWS handles infra best practices and standards with unique needs of cloud in mind
- redundant layered controls, continous validation and testing and automation to ensure underlying infra is monitored and protected 24/7
    - consistent application of security controls and monitor across all environments
- customers are responsible for setting up their environment in a secure and controlled manner
- customers need to maintain adequate governance over IT control environment
- audit friendly service features with applicable compliance or audit standards
- SOC, ISAE 3402, SOC 2, SOC 3 standards
- FISMA, DIACAP, FedRAMP
- PCI DSS level 1
- ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27018

AWS Cloud Computing Platform
- Access using AWS CLI, SDK, Management Console
    - Management Console: web interface
    - CLI: unified tool used to manage AWS Cloud services
    - SDK: provide APIs that interacts with web services that make up AWS platform
        - support for many different languages and platforms

Compute and Network services
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
- can choose from a variety of OS and resource configs (memory, CPU, storage, etc)
- configurable but maintain complete control

AWS Lambda
- 0 administration compute platform with fine grained pricing structure
- backend
- runs on EC2s across AZs in a region

Auto Scaling
- allow capacity up or down automatically according conditions defined for a particular workload
- help maintain application availability and ensure the desired # of EC2 are running
- allows resources to scale in and out to match dynamic workloads
- well suited for stable demand patterns and to applications that experience hourly, daily, weekly variability in usage

Elastic Load Balancing
- distributes incoming application traffic across multi EC2 instances
- enable greater levels of fault tolerance and load balancing

Elastic Beanstalk
- fastest and simplest awy to get a web app up and running
- upload application code, service will handle details such as resource provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling and monitoring
- orgs retain full control over resources and can access underlying resources at any time

VPC
- allow orgs to provision a logically isolated section of AWS Cloud where they can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that they define
- complete control over env, including selection of IP range, creation of subnets, config of routing tables and network gateways
- extend their corp data center to AWS by using VPN or dedicated circuits (AWS Direct Connect)

Direct Connect
- establish dedicated network connection from DC to AWS
- private connectivity
- in many cases reduce cost, increase bandwidth throughput and provide a more consistent network experience than internet based VPN connections

Route 53
- HA scalable DNS web service
- reliable and cost effective way to route end users to applications
- serves as domain registrar (purchase and manage domains directly from AWS)

Storage and Content Delivery
S3
- highly durable and scalable object storage that handles virtually unlimited amounts of data and large number of concurrent users
- can store almost anything and access using HTTP based protocols
- can be used as backup/recovery, nearline archive, big data analysis, DR, hosting static cloud apps and content distribution

Glacier
- secure, durable, low cost storage service for data archiving and long term backup
- store large/small amount of data at very low cost per GB per month
- infrequently accesses where retrieval time of several hours is suitable
- S3 integrates closely with Glacier

Elastic Block Store (EBS)

CloudFormation
- a way to create/manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion
- JSON based template language that can describe AWS resources that are ncessary for a workload
- submit template to CloudFormation and service will provision and configure resources as described

CloudTrail
- records AWS API calls for an account and delivers logs files for audit and review
    - identity of the API caller, time of the call, source IP, request params, response elements returned by the service

AWS Config
- fully managed service that provides organizations with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history and configuration change notifications to enable security and governance
- discover existing AWS resources, export inventory with all config details and determine how it was configured at any point in time 
    - enables compliance auditing, security analysis, change tracking and troubleshooting

Security and identity
 Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- securely contorl access to AWS services and resources for users
- create/manage AWS users and groups using permissions to allow/deny access

Key Management Service (KMS)
- managed service that makes it easy to create and control encryption keys used to encrypt data and uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of keys
- integrated with several other services to protecte data stored with these services

Exam Essentials
Understand the global infrastructure
    - multiple locations composed of regions and AZ
    - each region is located in separate geographic areas
Understand regions
    - physical geographic locations consists of a cluster of data centers
    - regions are completely independent and designed to be completely isoalted from other regions
        - fault tolerance
        - resources are not replicated across regions unless specified
Understand AZ
    - one or more data center within a region, isolated from failures from other AZ
    - provides inexpensive, low latency netowrk connectivity to other zones in the same region
    - prevent single point of failure when resources are placed in multiple AZs

Understand the hybrid deployment model
    - pattern providing connectivity for infra and apps between cloud based resources and existing resources that are not in the cloud
